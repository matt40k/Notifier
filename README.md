# Notifier

Working an medium to large office you find reception need to sent messages to all staff working in the office, for things like, the food truck has arrived, the alarm are going to be tested at 2pm and can be ignored, someones car needs to be moved or other general messages that need to be distributed quickly across the office. Email may seem perfect for this, but over time you find these messages just get ignored. They end up in the clutter folder, junk or folks create a mail rule to delete them or they just plain ignore them. Imagine coming back off maternity leave and having to wade through daily "the food truck has arrived", now imagine if you also have the sandwich guy, the weekly fire alarm tests and you're looking at hundreds of junk emails. Notifier is a simple application that runs in the background and only pops up when new messages arrive, it has a short life, low impact. Its a simple idea inspired by clever people at [Haven Power](https://www.havenpower.com/).
